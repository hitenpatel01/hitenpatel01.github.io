Does this image reminds you of anything? No, its not my old computer with Windows XP but picture I took at Deep Creek Lake, MD during a memorial weekend vacation. Well, I agree that the iamge is not close to splendor of the Bliss (name of Windows XP default wallpaper image) but the place was really amazing, had awesome time with family & friends.

Does this image reminds you of anything? No, its not Windows XP desktop but a picture I clicked at Deep Creek Lake, MD during a memorial weekend vacation. Well, I agree that it is not even close to splendor of Bliss (name of Windows XP default wallpaper image) but the place was really amazing, had awesome time with family & friends.

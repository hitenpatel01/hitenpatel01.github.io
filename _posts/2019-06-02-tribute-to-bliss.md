Does this image reminds you of anything? No, its not Windows XP desktop but a picture I clicked at Deep Creek Lake, Maryland during a memorial weekend vacation. Well, I agree that it is not even close to splendor of Bliss (name of Windows XP default wallpaper image) but the place was really amazing. We enjoyed the view a lot, flew kites and had awesome time with family and few other friends. More about bliss on [Wikipedia].

![Tribute to Bliss](/assets/images/bliss_tribute_desktop.png)

I took this picture at Deep Creek Lake, MD during a memorial weekend vacation. Does it remind you of anything? 
While not even close to the splendor of Bliss, the default wallpaper of Windows XP while I looked at this landscape,
I was really tempted to take a picture and refresh my desktop with it. Beautiful indeed! both this view and Bliss.
